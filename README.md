This is the Codescript 2.0 Hackathon project created by Team Fantastic 4 consisting of Dipen Kalsi, Raghav Agarwal, Paras Jain and Bhagyansh Bhargava from MAIT, Delhi.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Socioeconomic disparities exacerbate these challenges, leaving marginalized students with limited access to quality career resources.
